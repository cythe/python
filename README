#### README

It's a garbage project, dreaming of reducing our unnecessary work.

We need to do some preparatory work before running this script.

1. We're going to put patches in a `directory`
2. We need to know the `low kernel version` of our SDK, and which upstream branch is SDK development based on
3. Of course, we also need to know which `high kernel version` we want to migrate patches to

(Three familiar philosophical issues??)

Then, we run our garbage script, and get a big chunk of output...

Currently, just indicates which patch should be drop (maybe not exactly)

#### Work log
[x] 1. Base struct of stripts.
[x] 2. For each patch, pick up a struct to descript it.
[x] 3. Find commitlog similar with this patch in `high kernel version`.
[ ] 4. Complete comparison function (just compare commit log).
[ ] 5. Add hunt struct.
[ ] 6. For each hunt, find the change log of it and do match.
[ ] 7. Integrated comparative logic, make it a useful script (Not a junk or demo...).
